    # If the pokemon is valid and it can save, we'll be redirected to that pokemon's show page
    if @pokemon.save
      redirect_to pokemon_path(@pokemon)

    # Same principle as the create method above, if the pokemon is valid and saves, we will be redirected to the show page, if not we will be seeing the form again with the information we filled out

      redirect_to pokemon_path(@pokemon)

  # After we destroy the pokemon, where does it make sense for us to be redirected to?  Probably the index page

  # This is the principle of using Strong Parameters.  The core idea here is we want to make sure we only allow specific information from the user to come through, specifically information we asked for, nothing more.  This prevents nefarious users from providing info that we may not want.  To get a better understanding of this, throw a raise into the create action and see the difference between the regular params and pokemon params in the little console at the bottom of the page
  def pokemon_params
    params.require(:pokemon).permit(:name, :address, :species, :found_on)
  end

  # Our little before action method that sets which pokemon we want to interact with before certain controller actions
  def set_pokemon
    @pokemon = Pokemon.find(params[:id])
